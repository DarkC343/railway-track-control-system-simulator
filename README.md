An automated control system simulator for railway track using C POSIX Pthread synchronization, multithreading and scheduling techniques. The purpose of this simple program is for learning POSIX scheduling and synchronization tools. The problem is described in `csc360_p2.pdf` and all the details are described there (i.e. scheduling rules).
## compile

## run
`./mts plan1.txt`
## example
You can open `examples/plan1-output.txt` and `examples/plan2-output.txt` to see the result of doing `./mts plan1.txt` and `./mts plan2.txt`, respectively.
